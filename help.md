# Help
Triggers are the intelligent alerts that make sure you never miss another business opportunity again.
Either search company information, or setup an alert to monitor global activity. We’ll notify you with a summary of information when we think there’s something you should know about.

# Controls
Triggers.ai recognises commands in English. To start, type a "get me news on <company name>" and hit Enter. To set up a new trigger, type "set up an alert on <company name>". Type “Delete alert on <company name>”. Type "What is new with <company name>" to get an update on recent news about the company.

# Troubleshooting: 

Please try to use familiar company names, rather than nicknames or stock symbols.

Type to respond to questions or select buttons with mouse when they are available.
